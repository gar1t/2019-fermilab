# Presentation at Fermilab

Want to do a demo of Guild.

Setup with "What's the point of Guild?"

## What's the point of Guild

- Automatically track experiments
- Do cool things with results
    - Compare runs
    - Troublshoot
    - Collaborate
    - Optimize models

## Demo steps

### Manual steps

Show a manual process. What's involved?

- Run a script
- Note the results - either from output or logged
- Save the the inputs
- Run script again

Who cares?

Time consuming and error prone to track and compare results manually.

### Same process using Guild

- Run script
- List runs
- Get run information
- Run again
- Compare
